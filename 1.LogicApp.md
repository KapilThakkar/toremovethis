_So, let&#39;s start with modifying the Logic App._

## Scenario 2 – Fetching the reviews of staff serving the Flying Solo Service along with star ratings

### Part A – Building the Logic App with integration of Text Analytics service

_So, here you already have Logic App created. All you need to do is integrate Azure function in existing Logic App._

1. Go to **Resource groups** option present in the favourites menu on the left side panel and select **Resource Group** named **&quot;SoloServiceResourceGrp&quot;**.
15. Go to **Cognitive Service** named **SoloServiceCognitiveService** click on **Keys** option copy **Key 1** by clicking on **Copy URL icon.**![](img/key1.png)
3. Go to **Resource groups** option present in the favourites menu on the left side panel and select **Resource Group** named **&quot;SoloServiceResourceGrp&quot;.**
4. Go to **Text Analytics** named **cognitiveservicestextanalytics.** Click on **Edit API connection** option present under **cognitiveservicestextanalytics** blade and paste copied key into **Account Key** textbox and click on **Save** button.
5. Switch to **Azure Portal** as launched in **Part A** of **Scenario 1.**
6. Go to **Resource groups** option present in the favourites menu on the left side panel and select **Resource Group** named **&quot;SoloServiceResourceGrp&quot;.**
7. Click on **Logic app** named **AnalyzeReviews** then click on **Logic app designer** option present under **AnalyzeReviews** blade.
21. Click on ![](img/plusicon.png)
 icon and select **Add an Action** option present in between **For each** and **Response** step.
 

 ![](img/logicapp1.png)

7. Search **Azure function** in the search box and select it by clicking on it.
2. Choose **Azure function app** and click on **Create new function.**
3. Add below code snippet in **Request body**.

```
 {
 &quot;review\_count&quot;: &quot;@length(triggerBody())&quot;,

 &quot;total\_score&quot;: &quot;@variables(&#39;Total\_Score&#39;)&quot;
 }
```

> ***Note:** The code snippet contains **JSON** body which we are passing to **Azure function**.
>It includes:
>- **review\_count** – to represent total reviews
>- **@length(triggerBody())** - To place total reviews count in JSON body
>- **total\_score** – to calculate sum of all reviews
>- **@variable(&#39;Total\_Score&#39;)** - To Place Total\_score value in JSON body

10. Click on **Next** button.
2. Enter Function name **&quot;Get\_avg\_score&quot;** andadd provided code snippet in code section.

```
module.exports = function (context, data) {

var total\_score = data.total\_score;

var review\_count = data.review\_count;

var average\_score = parseFloat(total\_score)/parseFloat(review\_count);

  //Response of the function to be used later.

context.res = {

    body:  average\_score

  };
                 context.done();
};
```

> **Note** :
>This code snippet of **Azure function** is responsible to find out the **average score** in which we are getting **total\_score** and **review\_count** from input data object and here we are calculating the **average score** and storing it into **average\_score** variable. The calculated **average score** **(average\_score)** will be returned in the body with the help of context object.

12. Click on **Create** button.

_Great! You have just integrated Azure functions in Logic app._

13. Click on **When a HTTP request is received** step of a logic app displayed in screenshot and Copy the **HTTP POST URL** from the expanded window as in Visual Studio we will consume that Logic app.

 ![](img/httpRequest.png)


_Now, let&#39;s start with consuming Logic app into visual studio._

14. Switch to **Visual Studio 2017** IDE.
2. Paste the copied URL ( **Logic app URL** ) in Line No. 50 of **GlobalSettings**. **cs** file.
3. Now press **ctrl+S** button from the keyboard to save the changes in the code.

Ex: - **public const string GetSoloServiceReviewUrl = &quot;HTTP POST URL &quot;;**

_Here we will start creating C# code to get reviews score using Azure function._

17. Go to **Dataservices** folder and click on it to expand it then, click on **SoloServiceProviders** and double click on **ISoloServiceProvider.cs** file.
2. Paste the given code snippet below in line number 12.



```

Task&lt;string&gt; GetReviewScore(List&lt;Reviews&gt; Reviews);

```

>**Note** : Here we declare **GetReviewScore(List&lt;Reviews&gt; Reviews)** method in **ISoloServiceProvider.cs** interface so that we can implement it into **SoloServiceProvider.cs** class.

19. Go to **Dataservices** folder and click on it to expand it then, click on **SoloServiceProviders** and double click on **ISoloServiceProvider.cs** file.
2. Put the below given Code Snippet after the **function** named - **&quot;public async Task&lt;string&gt; GetReviewScore(List&lt;Reviews&gt; Reviews)&quot;**

```

public async Task&lt;string&gt; GetReviewScore(List&lt;Reviews&gt; Reviews)

{

              HttpClient httpClient = CreateHttpClient();

string serialized = await Task.Run(() =&gt; JsonConvert.SerializeObject(Reviews, \_serializerSettings));

HttpResponseMessage response = await httpClient.PostAsync(GetSoloServiceReviewUrl,

                new StringContent(serialized, Encoding.UTF8, &quot;application/json&quot;));

            await HandleResponse(response);

            string responseData = await response.Content.ReadAsStringAsync();

            return await Task.Run(() =&gt; (responseData));

}

```

This Function will retrieve the information along with ratings of staff serving the Flying Solo Service from Logic App.



> **Note** :
>- The **GetReviewScore(List&lt;Reviews&gt; Reviews)** method is responsible for calling the Logic App to and to get the average score. It accepts List of reviews **(List&lt;Reviews&gt; Reviews)** as an input parameter and return string containing the average score.
>- **List&lt;Reviews&gt;** convert into JSON object using **JsonConvert.SerializeObject()** method and store the converted JSON into serialized string variable.
>- After that we will call Logic app using **httpClient.PostAsync()** method which accepts 2 parameters viz. first -**Logic App url(GetSoloServiceReviewUrl)** and second - **StringContent** object having JSON input data(serialized), encoding format (Encoding.UTF8) and data type(&quot;application/json&quot;).
>- After getting response in r **esponseData** variable with the help of **ReadAsStringAsync()** method, we will return it to calling method.

21. Now go to **View Model** folder and click on it to expand and double click on **SoloServiceViewModel.cs** file.
2. To modify the method named **&quot;InitializeAsync(****object **** navigationData)&quot;** , add below code snippet after line no. 66.


```

var Source\_SoloService\_Score = await \_soloServiceProvider.GetReviewScore(SS.Reviews);

SoloService.Source\_SoloService\_Score = float.Parse(Source\_SoloService\_Score, CultureInfo.InvariantCulture.NumberFormat) \* 5;

```

This function will display the information of source staff serving the Flying Solo Service.

> **Note** : Here we are setting property **Source\_SoloService\_Score,** by calling **GetReviewScore()** method which accepts **Reviews** as input parameter and return average score(ranges from 0 -1 floating number). Returned score will be converted into floating number and multiplied by 5 for plotting reviews star ratings on UI.

23. Now Add below code snippet after line 82.
2. Now press **ctrl+S** button from the keyboard to save the changes in the code.



```

 var Dest\_SoloService\_Score = await \_soloServiceProvider.GetReviewScore(SS.Reviews);

SoloService.Dest\_SoloService\_Score = float.Parse(Dest\_SoloService\_Score, CultureInfo.InvariantCulture.NumberFormat) \* 5;

```

This function will display the information of destination staff serving the Flying Solo Service.

> **Note** : Here we are setting property **Dest\_SoloService\_Score** , by calling **GetReviewScore()** method which accepts Reviews as input parameter and return average score(ranges from 0 -1 floating number). Returned score will be converted into floating number and multiplied by 5 for plotting reviews star ratings on UI.
